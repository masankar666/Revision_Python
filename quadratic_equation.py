#Python Program to Solve Quadratic Equation

#The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

#ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
#a, b and c are real numbers and
#a â‰  0

#Source Code

# Solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0

# import complex math module
import cmath

a = 10
b = 50
c = 60

# calculate the discriminant
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

# find two solutions
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))
print('The solution are {0}{1} and {2} %0.2f ' %d)
